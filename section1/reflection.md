## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  * The part about reading as mental exercise resonated with me
  * I already take short breaks and have started viewing learning as a process
  * I would like to start reading more. I stopped reading for pleasure several years ago and would like to start again.
  * I would add finding ways to test your knowledge. I feel like forcing myself to apply information helps it solidify in my memory.   

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

```ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

  * The # (hash/pound) character

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  * An integer is a whole number, while a float has a decimal

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby
puts animal
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  * Interpolation is using a placeholder in a string to recall earlier inputted data

  ```ruby
  puts "A #{animal} dies every day crossing the river."
  ```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

  * You assign a variable to `gets.chomp` Then, when prompted, the user enters an answer that will automatically be assigned to the variable that you have previously chosen

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

  * Getting length of a string can be achieved with `str.length`
  * Reversal of a string can be achieved with `str.reverse`
