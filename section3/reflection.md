## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  - "Believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice" resonated with me. It is reassuring to remember that the effort has been translating into improvement.

  - "By striving to improve within one’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Problem solving takes place within reach of one’s capabilities with some help or guidance." This is also encouraging to reflect on. Some of my peers are starting from different levels of skill/knowledge but everyone can improve from a given starting point.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  - I would say that I display a growth mindset in my attitude towards learning from failure. I use mistakes to improve and do not let them discourage me.

  - I think I do not (yet) display the growth mindset attribute of "Seeking out challenges". I have no need to seek them out yet, they are successfully finding me by themselves.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

  - An array stores a list of data, while a hash stores key-value pairs of data.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```ruby
pet_store = {hamsters: 37, rats: 25, gerbils: 101}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```ruby
states.values[1]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```ruby
states.keys
states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

  - You could use a hash to store athletes names and corresponding positions that they play.
  - A hash can store info similar to an array, but can also hold additional related information.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

  - None yet, will update if I experience any issues
